Data Sources: Connecting to SQL Server, Excel, APIs, and cloud sources.
Data Transformation: Power Query Editor basics (M language overview).
Data Modeling:

Relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).
Star vs Snowflake schema.
Role of fact and dimension tables.




✅ 2. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Basic Functions:

SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTROWS, DISTINCTCOUNT.


Filter Functions:

CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, ALLEXCEPT.


Time Intelligence:

SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATEADD, TOTALYTD.


Row Context vs Filter Context:

Understand evaluation context deeply.


Variables in DAX:

Using VAR for optimization.




✅ 3. Visualization & Reporting

Best practices for visual design.
Conditional formatting.
Drill-through, bookmarks, and tooltips.
Custom visuals and KPI indicators.


✅ 4. Performance Optimization

Aggregations and summarization.
Query folding in Power Query.
Reducing model size (data types, removing unnecessary columns).

✅ 5. Advanced Topics

Row-Level Security (RLS):

Static vs Dynamic RLS.


Deployment Pipelines:

Dev → Test → Prod.


Power BI Service Features:

Workspaces, Apps, Dataflows.


Integration:

Power BI with Azure, APIs, and embedding reports.
